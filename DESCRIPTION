Description: jDMRgrid is a component of the jDMR toolkit, an essential tool for conducting efficient and heuristic DMR (Differentially Methylated Region) calling in large-scale epigenomic studies involving population-level analyses and control/treatment experiments. 
    Its functionality relies on a grid-based methodology that involves dividing the genome into sliding windows or bins of customizable sizes. 
    It determines methylation state calls for each individual sliding window based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach. 
    Subsequently, these calls are consolidated into a matrix format by merging data from all samples. 
    Additionally, user can perform a filtration of DMR matrix to remove non-polymorphic patterns from the merged matrix.
